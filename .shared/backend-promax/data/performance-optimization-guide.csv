Category,Technique,Implementation,Impact,Senior_Logic,Trade_off
Database,B-Tree Indexing,Create composite indexes for common query filters.,High Read Speed,Index order must match query order; avoid over-indexing.,Write Latency vs Read Speed
Database,Partitioning / Sharding,Horizontal split of large tables by key (UserID; Region).,Massive Scale,Distribute load; avoid cross-shard joins.,Complexity vs Scale
I/O,Connection Pooling,Keep a warm pool of DB connections.,Reduced Latency,Avoid handshake overhead; tune pool size to CPU cores.,Memory vs Latency
I/O,Non-blocking I/O,Use async/await for network calls.,Concurrency,Never block the thread pool; handles massive connections.,Debug complexity vs Throughput
Code,Memory Profiling,Identify leaks and high-alloc object pools.,Stability,Reuse objects in HFT/High-load apps to avoid GC pressure.,Code complexity vs Memory efficiency
Cache,Pre-fetching,Load data into cache before user requests.,Zero Latency,Predictive caching based on user behavior.,Cache waste vs UX Speed
